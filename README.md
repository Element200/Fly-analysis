# Fly-analysis
Contains programs to analyse various aspects if a tethered fly

So far, only codes that analyse winglengths have been added. There are conventions to be followed here, but hopefully, this can be made more
unbreakable in the future.

Conventions:

Point 1: Left wing apex
Point 2: Right wing apex
Point 3: Left wing base
Point 4: Right wing base
Point 5: Head base (not used in winglength analysis codes.
