# Fly-analysis
Contains programs to analyse various aspects of a tethered fly

So far, only codes that analyse winglengths have been added. There are conventions to be followed here but hopefully this can be made more
unbreakable in the future. I've got rid of the wing numbering convention, now you can enter whatever convention is used in the file you digitized.

Asymmetric wings: Points 1, 2 = left, right wing apices respectively. Points 3, 4 = left, right wing bases respectively. Point 5 = head base
Slit sc: Point 1 = head base. Point 2, 3 = left, right wing bases respectively. Point 4, 5 = left, right wing apices respectively.
